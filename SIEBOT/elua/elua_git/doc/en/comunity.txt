Forums
------
eLua doesn't have a dedicated forum at this point. However, our *developers and users discussion list* is "mirrored" in a forum-like format at
http://elua-development.2368040.n2.nabble.com[this address] (using the services provided by http://www.nable.com[Nabble]).

[[irc]]
IRC
---
*#elua* is the official IRC channel of eLua, it can be found on http://freenode.net[freenode]. If you can't use an IRC client (for example because
your firewall blocks IRC ports) you can still try to access the IRC channel using the http://wiki.eluaproject.net/IRC[Web based client].
The conversations on the IRC channel are logged and are available at http://irclogs.ls-themes.org/freenode/elua/logs. + 
And since you're on frenode, you might want to check the `#lua` channel as well (for discussions regarding the Lua language in general).
