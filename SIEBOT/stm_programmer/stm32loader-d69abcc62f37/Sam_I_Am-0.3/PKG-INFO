Description: Sam_I_Am is an interface to Atmel AT91SAM7S microcontrollers
        running the built-in SAM-BA program. It allows reading and
        writing memory locations, displaying peripheral status, and
        writing programs to either RAM or FLASH.
        
        To run the program, invoke the Python interpreter on the
        samiam.py file. The Sam_I_Am shell script in /usr/bin or
        /usr/local/bin (or similar) can be used to perform this action.
        
        For more details on installation or running Sam_I_Am, see the
