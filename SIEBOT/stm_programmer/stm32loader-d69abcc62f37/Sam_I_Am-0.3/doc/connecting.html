<H2>Introduction</H2>

Sam_I_Am expects to communicate with SAM-BA over a USB interface, not a serial port (even though SAM-BA can do both). This means that:
<UL>
<LI>The microcontroller must be on a board that uses the microcontroller's USB peripheral</LI>
<LI>The microcontroller must be clocked by a 18.432 MHz crystal/oscillator</LI>
<LI>SAM-BA must be installed on the microcontroller</LI>
<LI>The Linux kernel must recognize the microcontroller when the USB cable is plugged in and then load the correct driver</LI>
</UL>

<P>The first two points above are either true or not -- there's not much you can do if they're not. The Atmel AT91SAM7S64-EK development kit satisfies both of these points. This board was used for developing Sam_I_Am thus is known to work.
<P>The sections below address the last two points.

<P><A NAME="InstallingSAMBA"></A>
<H2>Installing SAM-BA</H2>

The SAM-BA monitor code is always present on the AT91SAM7S microcontrollers in
a hidden read-only memory. For SAM-BA to run, it must be copied into the
microcontroller's FLASH memory. The procedure for doing this is as follows:

<OL>
<LI>With the microcontroller board power off, connect the TST pin on the microcontroller to VDDIO (e.g., 3.3V if VDDIO is 3.3V). On
the AT91SAM7S64-EK development kit, this is accomplished by installing the TST jumper (JP5).</LI>
<LI>Ensure that pins PA0, PA1, and PA2 are high (they have internal pullups so if they are left disconnected then they will read as high).</LI>
<LI>Apply power to the microcontroller. Wait 10 seconds. Remove power.</LI>
<LI>Remove the TST pin connection to VDDIO.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The effect of this process is that the first two pages of FLASH memory will be overwritten with the SAM-BA program. When power is applied to the microcontroller again, SAM-BA will automatically execute.

<P><A NAME="SerialDriver"></A>
<H2>USB Serial Driver</H2>

The easiest way to have Linux recognize the microcontroller's USB peripheral is to use the <TT>usbserial</TT> kernel module.
You simply have to type (as root):

<PRE>   modprobe usbserial vendor=0x03EB product=0x6124</PRE>

<P>If the above worked without any error messages, you can plug in your device.

<P>You can then talk to SAM-BA using a standard terminal emulator (such as minicom) using the <TT>/dev/ttyUSB0</TT> device, or whatever device name has been created on your system with a major device number of 188. This device name may be <TT>/dev/ttyUSB1</TT>, etc. if you are already using the serial driver for other devices. If you are using devfs, you should see your device as <TT>/dev/usb/tts/0</TT>, or <TT>/dev/usb/tts/1</TT>, etc.
<P>If you cannot find either of the above filenames, you can find the right device by searching for the
special device file name that corresponds to the major device number of 188:

<PRE>   find /dev -inum `ls -liR /dev | fgrep "188," | head -1 | sed -e "s/^ *//" | cut -d" " -f1`</PRE>

<P>If the above command does not display any files, then the distribution you are using did not create a file association
to the <TT>usbserial</TT> driver. You can easily create one on your own. As root, type:

<PRE>   mknod -m 0666 /dev/ttyUSB0 c 188 0</PRE>

<P>This will create the character-special file <TT>/dev/ttyUSB0</TT> (with
read-write permissions for everyone) and associate it with a major device
number of 188 and minor number of 0.

<P>The <TT>modprobe</TT> command will fail if you do not have the
<TT>usbserial</TT> kernel module compiled, in which case you will have to learn
about compiling a kernel and installing it. This process is well-described by
the <A HREF="http://www.digitalhermit.com/linux/Kernel-Build-HOWTO.html">Kernel
Rebuild Guide</A>.

<P>You may have to be root to access the special file (<TT>/dev/ttyUSB0</TT>). If you want to be able to access the special device as
a normal user, you will have to use the <TT>chmod</TT> command to give regular users permission to read and write from it:

<PRE>   chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0</PRE>

<P>The process may also fail you have another kernel module that interferes with <TT>usbserial</TT>. The <TT>acm</TT> module in 2.4 kernels and the <TT>cdc-acm</TT> module in 2.6 kernels may be the source of this interference as they implement the USB Communications Device Class
(see the next section). Try removing those modules (using <TT>modprobe -r acm</TT> or <TT>modprobe -r cdc-acm</TT>) first.

<P>As a last resort, try running the <TT>depmod</TT> command (as root) to make sure your module dependencies are up-to-date.

<P><A NAME="CDCDriver"></A>
<H2>USB Communications Device Class Driver</H2>

The SAM-BA documentation indicates that it configures the AT91SAM7S microcontroller as a USB Communications Device Class device. Thus,
the Linux <TT>acm</TT> (for 2.4 kernels) or <TT>cdc-acm</TT> (for 2.6 kernels) should be usable.
<P>No instructions for the 2.4 kernel <TT>acm</TT> driver are available yet.
<P>For the 2.6 kernel <TT>cdc-acm</TT> driver, the driver source code must be patched and the kernel module recompiled in order to
recognize the microcontroller.

The first step is to modify the <TT>cdc-acm.c</TT> file in the kernel source tree (e.g., /usr/src/linux-2.6.14.3/drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c) to add the following three lines marked with '+' signs:

<PRE>
      { USB_DEVICE(0x0482, 0x0203), /* KYOCERA AH-K3001V */
      .driver_info = NO_UNION_NORMAL, /* has no union descriptor */
      },
    + { USB_DEVICE(0x03EB, 0x6124), /* Atmel AT91SAM7S microcontrollers (SAM-BA) */
    + .driver_info = NO_UNION_NORMAL,
    + },
      /* control interfaces with various AT-command sets */
      { USB_INTERFACE_INFO(USB_CLASS_COMM, USB_CDC_SUBCLASS_ACM,
</PRE>

Next, recompile the kernel and ensure that the <TT>cdc-acm</TT> driver is compiled as a module.

The new kernel has to be installed and booted. The new kernel module can then be installed with (as root):

<PRE>  modprobe cdc-acm</PRE>

When you plug in the microcontroller device, you should be able to communicate
with it using a filename of <TT>/dev/usb/acm/0</TT>, or <TT>/dev/ttyACM0</TT>,
or other names depending on your distribution. You can try to find the right
name on your system using the same type of command used to find the <TT>usbserial</TT> devices
from the previous section:

<PRE>   find /dev -inum `ls -liR /dev | fgrep "166," | head -1 | sed -e "s/^ *//" | cut -d" " -f1`</PRE>

<P>The major device number for the <TT>cdc-acm</TT> module is 166. If this
special file has not been created, you can create it yourself (as root):

<PRE>
     mkdir -p /dev/usb/acm
     chmod -R a+rx /dev/usb
     mknod /dev/usb/acm/0 c 166 0
     mknod /dev/usb/acm/1 c 166 1
     mknod /dev/usb/acm/2 c 166 2
     chmod -R a+rwx /dev/usb/acm
</PRE>

<P>The above allows anyone on the system access to these devices. You may want to modify your <TT>chmod</TT> commands for alternative
access arrangements if you are running a multi-user system.
