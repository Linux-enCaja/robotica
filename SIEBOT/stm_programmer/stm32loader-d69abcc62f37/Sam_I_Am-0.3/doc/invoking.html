<H2>Introduction</H2>

Sam_I_Am is invoked from the command line within a terminal/shell/console
program (rxvt, xterm, Konsole, gnome-terminal, etc.) After opening a console,
you should simply be able to type:

<PRE>    Sam_I_Am --version</PRE>

This will verify that Sam_I_Am is properly installed and accessible. If this
does not work, you need to find out where Sam_I_Am was installed. Type the
following:

<PRE>    python -c "import sys; print sys.prefix+'/lib/python'+sys.version[:3]"</PRE>

You should see a directory name such as <TT>/usr/lib/python2.3</TT>. You can
then invoke Sam_I_Am as follows:

<PRE>    python /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/Sam_I_Am/samiam.py</PRE>

If this still does not work, try the <A HREF="index.html#Installation">Installation</A> instructions again.

<P><A NAME="Options"></A>
<H2>Command-Line Options</H2>

By default, simply typing <TT>Sam_I_Am</TT> will perform the following tasks:
<OL>
<LI>Find and execute the commands in any startup script files (see the <A HREF="#RCFiles">Startup Files</A> below)</LI>
<LI>Enter an interactive command mode</LI>
</OL>

The following command-line options modify this default behavior:

<DL>
<DT><B><TT>-x FILE</TT></B> or <B><TT>--rc-file=FILE</TT></B></DT>
<DD>The default startup script file is either <TT>.samiamrc</TT> in the current directory or, if not found, the file
<TT>.samiamrc</TT> in the HOME directory (i.e., <TT>${HOME}/.samiamrc</TT>). With this option specified, however,
the startup script file in this option is used instead.</DD>

<DT><B><TT>-X</TT></B> or <B><TT>--norc-file</TT></B></DT>
<DD>This option prevents Sam_I_Am from executing any startup script files.</DD>

<DT><B><TT>-i</TT></B> or <B><TT>--interactive</TT></B></DT>
<DD>Normally, when command-line commands are given (see the <A
HREF="#SingleCmds">Command-Line Commands</A> section below) Sam_I_Am will
perform those commands and exit. With this option specified, Sam_I_Am will
perform the commands and then remain in interactive mode.</DD>
</DL>

Finally, the <TT>--help</TT> and <TT>--version</TT> command-line options print a brief help summary and program
version, respectively.

<P><A NAME="RCFiles"></A>
<H2>Startup Files</H2>

Sam_I_Am can execute a sequence of commands stored in a file every time it runs. This behavior can be useful to, for
example, automatically connect to SAM-BA, set protected memory regions, and so on.

<P>In its normal mode of operation, Sam_I_Am looks in the current directory for a file named <TT>.samiamrc</TT>. If
found, the commands in this file are executed as if they had been typed by you at the keyboard in interactive mode.
Once all commands are executed, Sam_I_Am enters interactive mode in which you can begin typing your own commands.

<P>If no <TT>.samiamrc</TT> file is found in your current directory, the same file name is loaded, if it exists,
from your home directory (i.e., <TT>${HOME}/.samiamrc</TT>). If this file does not exist here either, then no startup
file is loaded.

<P>Here is a sample <TT>.samiamrc</TT> file that opens a connection to SAM-BA, prints the SAM-BA version, then
sets allowable memory accesses to correspond to the memory map of an AT91SAM7S256 device:
<PRE>
      open /dev/ttyUSB0
      version
      set readallow 0 0x300000
      set ramwriteallow 0x202000 57344
      set flashwriteallow 0x100000 0x40000
</PRE>      
<P>Sam_I_Am can be told to either ignore startup files or execute a startup
file other than <TT>.samiamrc</TT> depending upon the command-line options
presented in the previous section.

<P><A NAME="SingleCmds"></A>
<H2>Command-Line Commands</H2>

Additional arguments to Sam_I_Am on the command line are interpreted as
commands as if they were typed in interactive mode. These commands are
performed <I>after</I> executing any startup files. For example:
<PRE>
    Sam_I_Am dump 0x202000
</PRE>
The above command would rely upon the presence of a <TT>.samiamrc</TT> file
that contained an <TT>open</TT> command so that the <TT>dump</TT> command would
be successful.

<P>Multiple commands can be executed by separating them with isolated commas.
After all commands are performed, Sam_I_Am exits (unless the <B><TT>-i</TT></B>
or <B><TT>--interactive</TT></B> command-line option is specified).

<P>For example:
<PRE>
    Sam_I_Am open /dev/ttyUSB0 , send program.hex , go
</PRE>
The above command opens the device port (assuming no <TT>.samiamrc</TT> file
does so), uploads a HEX file, and runs the program uploaded. As soon as the GO
command is issued, Sam_I_Am exits (though the uploaded program continues to
run).

<P>The following example uses the <TT>source</TT> command to effectively execute two
startup files, <TT>.samiamrc</TT> and <TT>run.sam</TT>, and then remain in
interactive mode to accept more commands:
<PRE>
    Sam_I_Am -i source run.sam
</PRE>
