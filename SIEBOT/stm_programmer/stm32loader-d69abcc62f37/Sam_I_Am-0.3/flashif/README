This directory contains the helper application that is used to perform FLASH
programming. When the Sam_I_Am 'flash' command is given, this application is
loaded into RAM and is executed. Sam_I_Am then communicates with this
application to perform the actual FLASH programming. Once the process is
complete, control returns to SAM-BA.

The contents of this directory are provided only for reference. There is no
need to compile this application as it is already a part of Sam_I_Am.

Specifically, the flashif.py file in Sam_I_Am contains an embedded version of
the Intel HEX records for this program (flashif.hex), obtained by typing
'make'. If you want to make changes, then recompile this program and update
flashif.py with the new HEX file contents.
