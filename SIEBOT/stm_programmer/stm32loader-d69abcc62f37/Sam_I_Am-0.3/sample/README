This directory contains a simple application for the Atmel
AT91SAM7S64-EK development board. It simply blinks an LED on
the development board 5 times. The application demonstrates
the process of compilation and downloading to the board using
Sam_I_Am.

This application was compiled using the GNUARM tools version
3.4.6.

The .samiamrc file in this directory contains the 'open' command
that establishes a connection to the development board. If your
board does not appear as device /dev/ttyUSB0, then you should
edit .samiamrc accordingly.

Type 'make' to compile the application, and 'make run' to run
it.

A FLASH-based version of the application is also compiled. Type
'make flash' to program FLASH with the application (it will not
overwrite SAM-BA) and 'make runflash' to run it from FLASH.
